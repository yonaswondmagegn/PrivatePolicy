  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This Chrome extension respects your privacy. This document explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>1. History</h2>
  <p>We use browsing history only to improve the functionality of the extension, such as determining the user’s previous navigation path or restoring state.</p>

  <h2>2. Identity</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information unless explicitly required for authentication with third-party services. In such cases, the data is used solely for session identification and is not stored or shared.</p>

  <h2>3. Remote Code</h2>
  <p>The extension may load remote scripts for update or feature delivery purposes. These scripts are secure, hosted on trusted servers, and are strictly necessary for the extension's functionality.</p>

  <h2>4. Sessions</h2>
  <p>Sessions are used to maintain the state of the extension while it's running. This helps in providing a seamless user experience.</p>

  <h2>5. Storage</h2>
  <p>We use Chrome’s `storage` API to store preferences, settings, or temporary data locally. None of this data is transmitted or shared.</p>

  <h2>6. Tabs</h2>
  <p>The extension may access tab data to perform its core functions, such as interacting with content on the page or injecting scripts.</p>

  <h2>7. Web Navigation</h2>
  <p>Web navigation data is only used to detect when certain pages are loaded, which enables features of the extension relevant to those pages.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to contact us at [your-email@example.com]</p>
