The Extension does not collect or transmit any personal information to any server or third party. All data used by the Extension is stored locally in your browser and is used solely for the functionality of the Extension.

Specifically:
Browsing History: Accessed only to identify and delete visits to blocked or flagged websites.

Tabs & Sessions: Used to monitor real-time activity and remove browsing history only after the tab or window is closed.

Storage: Used to store user preferences, including custom blocked sites and any removed URLs, locally in your browser.

2. How We Use Your Information
All information accessed by the Extension is used locally and automatically to:

Detect visits to blocked or adult content websites.

Delete such entries from your browsing history.

Store your preferences like custom sites to block or allow.

We do not send, share, or sell any data to third parties.

3. Permissions
To perform its intended function, the Extension requires the following permissions:
